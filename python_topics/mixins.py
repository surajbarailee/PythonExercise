# MIXINS are ordinary multiple inheritance
# Python doesnt have any special keywords for mixins
# They are just the way of using Classes
# Mixins are not derived classes
# Mixins are used when we want to reuse a particular feature in a lot of different classes
# Mixins :
#   Single Responsibility
#   Not meant to be extended
#   Not meant to be instantiated
