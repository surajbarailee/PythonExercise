# A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every o
# object in python. An object might be a variable or a method.
# Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. 
# Theyâ€™re stored in a special attribute called .__dict__.
