sequence types :
a collection where contained objects are retrievable by their index.The object can report the number of contained objects. ( length )

other sequence types : 
tuple range bytes bytearray str memoryview



abc.Sequence -> sequence.register(tuple, str, range, memoryview)

abc.Sequence-> abc.MutableSequence -> list, bytearray

abc.ByteString -> bytes, bytearray



list is a sequence types 
dict is a mapping type


object hashing and equzlity
why hashing is important ?

HAshing is converting the value of an object of unknown sixe to a value of a fixed immutable size

hash(obj) calls __hash__

set dict and other mapping types care about hashing

hash table for keys
predictable hash values 

hash collision
if your object implements __hash__ you must also implement __eq__

dataclass decorator


defaultdict, counter and ordered dict


named tuple

namedtuple vs dataclass
deque
