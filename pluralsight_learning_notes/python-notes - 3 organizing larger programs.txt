modularization
how python locates modules -> checks sys.path that gives list of directories ...goes on checking for modules one by one ..if not found raises Import Error
locatingh modules with python path

package directory paths are stored in __path__
sys.path controls module search

PEP420 and __init__.py
__init__.py optional in python 3.3+
demo_Reader.__file__
A package is a directory containing __init__.py file
relative imports

__all__ used to control from module import * behavior
if not specified,import all public names
must be a list of strings
-Each entry is a name to import

__all__=['asd','asd1']

PEP 420 :implicit namespace packages

executable directories

executable zip files - python knows how to zip files

__init.pr can execute any code it likes on import
but only a package with __main__.py can be executed
